I am an experienced Data Scientist currently serving as the Associate Director in Marketing Sciences at Horizon Media, NY, my focus lies in applying causal inference models and machine learning algorithms to extract meaningful insights from extensive consumer datasets. I am particularly intrigued by the potential of these analytical approaches to uncover patterns, trends, and causal relationships within large-scale consumer data, ultimately contributing valuable insights for informed decision-making in the dynamic field of marketing.
