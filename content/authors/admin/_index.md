I am a Senior Data Scientist at Publicis Starcom (Chicago, IL) with 5+ years of experience in machine learning, generative AI, and causal inference for marketing and business intelligence. I use Python, R, and SQL to deliver predictive modeling, customer segmentation, and A/B testing that improve campaign performance and optimize ad spend. I build scalable analytics solutions on Snowflake, Azure, and Databricks, lead cross-functional initiatives, and mentor junior data scientists to turn complex data into clear business action.
