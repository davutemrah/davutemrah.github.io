Introduction In this capstone project, we are given three sources of text such as twitter, blog and news written in English. We are expected to build a statistical model making text predictions given one or more texts/words.\nI will start my project reading the data and explore some insights.\nData We have three sources of data. Following code will download and unzip the file.\nurl \u0026lt;- \u0026#34;https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip\u0026#34; if(!file.exists(\u0026#34;./data\u0026#34;)){ dir.create(\u0026#34;./data\u0026#34;) download.file(url, destfile=\u0026#34;./data/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip\u0026#34;, mode = \u0026#34;wb\u0026#34;) unzip(zipfile=\u0026#34;./data/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip\u0026#34;, exdir=\u0026#34;./data\u0026#34;) } Load Data Here is a function to read the raw data\nread_raw_text \u0026lt;- function(input, output){ con \u0026lt;- file(input, open = \u0026#34;r\u0026#34;) output \u0026lt;- readLines(con = con, encoding = \u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;, skipNul = TRUE) close(con = con) # closing connection is important output } Twitter data\ntwitter \u0026lt;- read_raw_text(\u0026#34;data/final/en_US/en_US.twitter.txt\u0026#34;) #stri_stats_general(twitter) # basic info head(twitter, n=3) paste(\u0026#34;US_twitter data has\u0026#34;, length(twitter), \u0026#34;lines\u0026#34;) paste(\u0026#34;Size of the twitter file is about\u0026#34;, round(object.size(twitter)/1024^2, 3), \u0026#34;MB\u0026#34;) paste(\u0026#34;Longest line has\u0026#34;, max(str_length(twitter)), \u0026#34;characters\u0026#34;) Blogs Data\nblog \u0026lt;- read_raw_text(\u0026#34;data/final/en_US/en_US.blogs.txt\u0026#34;) #stri_stats_general(blog) # basic info head(blog, n=3) As seen above, there seems to be more words in blog data, than twitter data.\npaste(\u0026#34;US_blogs data has\u0026#34;, length(blog), \u0026#34;lines\u0026#34;) paste(\u0026#34;size of the blogs file is about\u0026#34;, round(object.size(blog)/1024^2, 3), \u0026#34;MB\u0026#34;) paste(\u0026#34;Longest line has\u0026#34;, max(str_length(blog)), \u0026#34;characters\u0026#34;) News Data\nnews \u0026lt;- read_raw_text(\u0026#34;data/final/en_US/en_US.news.txt\u0026#34;) #stri_stats_general(news) # basic info head(news, n=3) paste(\u0026#34;US_news data has\u0026#34;, length(news), \u0026#34;lines\u0026#34;) paste(\u0026#34;Size of the news file is about\u0026#34;, round(object.size(news)/1024^2, 3), \u0026#34;MB\u0026#34;) paste(\u0026#34;Longest line has\u0026#34;, max(str_length(news)), \u0026#34;characters\u0026#34;) Corpus Creation We have three big data sets. I will take 1% random samples from each to create the corpus. This will provide enough coverage to explore data and build a prediction model.\nI combine 1% samples of each data sets into one corpus.\nset.seed(1234) samples \u0026lt;- function(file, fraction){ output \u0026lt;- sample(file, size = fraction*length(file), replace = FALSE) } blog_s \u0026lt;- samples(blog, fraction=0.01) news_s \u0026lt;- samples(news, fraction=0.01) twitter_s \u0026lt;- samples(twitter, fraction=0.01) corpus \u0026lt;- c(blog_s, news_s, twitter_s) Training and Test samples I will divide the 1% samples of each data sets into 80% for training and 20% test samples.\nset.seed(1234) train \u0026lt;- c(sample(blog_s, size = 0.8*length(blog_s)), sample(news_s, size = 0.8*length(news_s)), sample(twitter_s, size = 0.8*length(twitter_s))) test \u0026lt;- setdiff(corpus, train) rm(blog_s, news_s,twitter_s) Text Cleaning\nThere are several factor we need to consider when cleaning/normalizing text data. And there are pros/cons about how much we clean the text data.\nThere are punctuation combining the words, replacing the letters, stopping the sentences and repetitions. In many applications you can observe any type of punctuation may be erased or some of them kept untouched.\nExamples: “I’am”, “middle-class”, “stop!”, “what?”, “apple, banana” etc.\nI chose to erase numbers, since they can be confusing and not predictable.\nI transform all alphabetic characters to lowercase.\nI erase unnecessary white-space.\nNon-ASCII symbols are to be removed\nStop-words are common words are dropped in most text-mining applications, because they have low information. But in this project we build a text prediction model and, I prefer to keep them for now.\nStemming is another factor when processing text data before training model.\nProfanity filter is another subject to consider. There are collections available to use but I prefer not to use at this time.\ntrain_df \u0026lt;- as_tibble(train) train_df$value \u0026lt;- str_replace_all(train_df$value, c(\u0026#34;[:punct:]\u0026#34; = \u0026#34; \u0026#34;, \u0026#34;[0-9]\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;[:space:]+\u0026#34; = \u0026#34; \u0026#34;)) Tokenization For text mining purposes I will use functions from tidytext library. I transform sentences into one word in a row, then exclude missing values.\nThen I can calculate frequencies of the words and sort them in descending order.\nOne-Word\nHere I show most 20 frequently used words in a graph. Most frequent word is “the”.\noneword \u0026lt;- train_df %\u0026gt;% unnest_tokens(output = word, input = value, to_lower = TRUE) %\u0026gt;% drop_na(word) %\u0026gt;% count(word, sort = TRUE) ggplot(oneword[1:20, ], aes(x = reorder(word, -n), y = n)) + geom_bar(stat = \u0026#34;identity\u0026#34;, fill = \u0026#34;steelblue\u0026#34;) + geom_text(aes(label=n), vjust=1.6, color=\u0026#34;white\u0026#34;, size=2.5) + theme(axis.text.y=element_blank(), axis.ticks.y=element_blank()) + ggtitle(\u0026#34;20 Most Frequently Used Words\u0026#34;) + …","date":1643932800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1719532800,"objectID":"2c6006bf102cab9779a97ff8827c78df","permalink":"https://davutemrah.github.io/post/2020-02-04-nextword/nextword_2022_02_04/","publishdate":"2022-02-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020-02-04-nextword/nextword_2022_02_04/","section":"post","summary":"This project is a R `Shiny` Web Application that uses `Stupid Back-off` N-gram models, a `Large Language Model`, to predict next words given input text.","tags":["LLM"],"title":"Next Word Prediction","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1643932800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643932800,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"https://davutemrah.github.io/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2022-02-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `github`. here is another link","tags":["Other"],"title":"Next Word Prediction","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":"Loading required packages\nlibrary(rvest) ## web scraping Here I read data from AEA website urls using read_html() function.\nurl1 \u0026lt;- \u0026#34;https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/committees/csmgep/neacode-a-l\u0026#34; url2 \u0026lt;- \u0026#34;https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/committees/csmgep/neacode-m-z\u0026#34; simple \u0026lt;- read_html(url1) simple2 \u0026lt;- read_html(url2) simple ## {html_document} ## \u0026lt;html class=\u0026#34;no-js\u0026#34; lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; ## [1] \u0026lt;head\u0026gt;\\n\u0026lt;meta http-equiv=\u0026#34;Content-Type\u0026#34; content=\u0026#34;text/html; charset=UTF-8 ... ## [2] \u0026lt;body class=\u0026#34;internal generic-detail\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\\n \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;cookie-legal-bann ...

You can focus on the content and Wowchemy handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you’ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Wowchemy.\nExamples Code Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can customize the styles under the syntax_highlighter option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() ``` renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() Mindmaps Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.\nSimply insert a Markdown markmap code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.\nA simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:\n```markmap {height=\u0026#34;200px\u0026#34;} - Hugo Modules - wowchemy - blox-plugins-netlify - blox-plugins-netlify-cms - blox-plugins-reveal ``` renders as\n- Hugo Modules - wowchemy - blox-plugins-netlify - blox-plugins-netlify-cms - blox-plugins-reveal A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:\n```markmap - Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://docs.hugoblox.com/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/HugoBlox/hugo-blox-builder) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ ``` renders as\n- Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://docs.hugoblox.com/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/HugoBlox/hugo-blox-builder) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ Charts Wowchemy supports the popular Plotly format for interactive charts.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example line-chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;line-chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy math shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$ Example inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$ f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases} $$ Diagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ``` renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
